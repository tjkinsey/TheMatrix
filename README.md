# TheMatrix
Simple bash script that replicates the scene from the Matrix when Morpheus wakes up Neo.

I used it as a screen saver and freaked my friends out when my computer would go to sleep.

If you want to have a different name appear in the messages, replace "$(whoami)" on line 4 with 
whatever name you want. As is, the script will just print out the result of the whoami command.

If you want, you can store this file in /usr/bin that way you just need to type matrix in order to run it.
I made it a screen saver by recording this script running with quicktime screen recorder and then saved the video file as my screen saver. 

Might need to download tclsh to run script if you do not already have it installed.
